This version of the code that is actually a library.
	This is the first version of the code that is actually a library.
	As of 09/26/2024 I believe this revision is fully functional. However, I make no guarantees that this is the case.
		* Fully functional does NOT mean it is fast. Testing in the v0.3 revision has revealed that the function updateOutput(...) takes somewhere between 20 and 25 ms to complete on an Arduino Mega  2560.
