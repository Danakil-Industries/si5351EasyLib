   SI5351 Easy Library v0.4 PRELIMINARY

   Notes: This is the third version of the code that is implemented as a library.
          I am also not the best programmer.
           I recognize the fact that my code is likely hard to understand and/or is trash.
		   This is also the first true library that I have written.
          This code has only been tested using an SI5351A in a 10-MSOP package because it's the only type I currently have.
           I'm using the Adafruit breakout board for those who will ask.
           This also means that outputs 3-5 have not been tested yet. That said, it is highly likely that they will work just fine.
          KEEP PLL A SET TO 750 MHz!
           The frequency setting code relies on this frequency
           
   I release this code for use with non-profit projects(e.g. hobby projects) and/or open source projects/products.
      Use of any of this code in any closed-source products requires explicit permission from Danakil Industries on a per product basis.
        Whomst can be contacted via github or email.

        Failure to aquire permission for use in closed-source products may result in:
          My feelings being hurt
          Something else if I feel like it
  
  @section Dependencies
  This library requires one or more other libraries to work. Wether or not thesre need to be manually installed still needs to be investigated.
